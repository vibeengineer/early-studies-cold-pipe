Early Studies is a forward-thinking research firm that has pioneered the "Future Perfect Methodology," a revolutionary approach to understanding social dynamics and human behavior. Their methodology addresses critical limitations in traditional research by combining three powerful techniques:

Social Circle Surveying: Instead of asking individuals directly about their own behaviors (which often triggers social performance bias), Early Studies asks respondents about patterns they observe in their social circles. This approach reveals collective narratives and accesses deeper truths that might otherwise remain hidden.
First Principles Questions: Rather than accepting surface-level explanations, Early Studies probes the underlying architecture of human behavior, revealing fundamental drivers and motivations.
Triple Tense Technique: By examining perspectives across time (past, present, and future), Early Studies captures not just static opinions but dynamic patterns of change, allowing for more accurate prediction of emerging trends.

Early Studies specializes in uncovering self-fulfilling social propheciesâ€”situations where collective beliefs actively shape reality through behavior and systemic responses. Their approach is particularly valuable for understanding complex social phenomena, such as urban division in Stockholm or digital intimacy patterns.

The firm's methodology offers significant advantages:

Requires smaller sample sizes (approximately 5% of traditional studies)
Provides deeper insights by bypassing social desirability bias
Offers temporal context that helps distinguish between temporary shifts and fundamental changes
Reveals how narratives evolve and potentially become self-reinforcing

For research and insights leaders seeking to understand deeply entrenched social patterns and anticipate emerging trends, Early Studies provides a methodological breakthrough that delivers more accurate, nuanced, and actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making.
